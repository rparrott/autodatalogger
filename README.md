# autodatalogger
Automotive datalogger built to be open source and customized to any vehicle and setup.
The goal is to use a raspberry pi and a MCP3008 to datalog 5v sensors and write them to a CSV. The program is setup to use up to 16 sensors, using two MCP3008's with a custom PCB. All files are open to be used, as well as edited and changed. I wish this to be a collabrative open source product. When a protype is built I will offer the PCB files for them to be printed.
